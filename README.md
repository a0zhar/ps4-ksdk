# PS4 KSDK

This repository contains my customized version of **Alexandro Sanchez Bach**'s SDK for PlayStation 4 kernel development. 
It is extremely useful when working on functions that are intended to run in **Kernel Mode**. ðŸ™‚

Currently, it supports the following PlayStation 4 Official Firmwares:

* `5.05`, `6.72`, `7.02`, `7.55`, and coming soon: **9.00** and **11.00**
